# Discord GIF Logger

Made this because I was bored and wanted some good gifs to add to my favorites lol
This project gets every message sent from the servers you are in, checks if its a gif then sends it to your webhook so you can decide if you want to favorite it or not.

You will need node.js to run this project.
Required modules: discord.js-selfbot-v13, cheerio, @replit/node-fetch (install using NPM)

Run this code in your Discord console to get your token (It will copy your token to your clipboard):
```js
copy((webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken())
```
